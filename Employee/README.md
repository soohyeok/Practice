Inheritance Challenge - Employees, Bosses and Trainees
Create a main class with a Main Method, then a base class Employee with the properties
Name, FirstName, Salary and the methods Work() and Pause().

Create a deriving class boss with the propertie CompanyCar and the method Lead().
Create another deriving class of employees - trainees with the properties WorkingHours and SchoolHourse and a method Learn().

Override the methods Work() of the trainee class so that it indicates the working hours of the trainee.

Donâ€™t forget to create the constructors.

Create an object of each of the three classes (with arbitrary values)

and call the methods, Lead() of Boss and Work() of Trainee.
